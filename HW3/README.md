Assignment 1 (file: a1.ipynb)

The goal of this assignment is to plot the sample means of different types of distributions, randomly generated by the built-in functions in numpy. The expected result would be a histogram of all the sample means that looks almost normally distributed.
I used Professor Bianco's plot enhancer through json and kept it in the same folder as the program. Then I set up two global variables, mean value and a list of sizes. The mean value is 10, and the list contains 100 different numbers between 10 and 2000 as the sizes of 100 different samples. Then I generated a list of types of distributions and put them in a dictionary as the key. The value of the dictionary is another dictionary inside it, which has the size as the key and the corresponding distribution, randomly generated through numpy functions, as the value. Then I plotted the sample mean vs sample size for each distribution to discover patterns, meanwhile adding all the 600 mean values to a list. In the end, I plotted a normalized histogram for all the 600 means, along with a normal distributioin fitted plot attached to the histogram.

I included the screenshots for the reentry program info in the same folder as the program. I pretty much just followed along the comments and steps and generated the p-value for the fourth row through z-score test and the sixth row through chi-squre test. I reached the "null hypothesis not rejected" result for both of these tests.
