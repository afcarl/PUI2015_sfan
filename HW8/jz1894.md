## Peer Review

![Alt text](peer_imgs/zhoujh20.png)

### Clarity
The visualization is clear and easy to follow. The original ipython notebook also includes legends.

### Esthetic
The choropleth map looks good and visualizes the result in an esthetic way.

### Honesty
The plot is honestly reproducing the data.

### Suggestion
It may be better to put legends and map into one image. Also, it may be good to specify those white blank spaces as missing values.
