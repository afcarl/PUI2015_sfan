### Clarity
The plot is easy to follow and quite clear about what information is being displayed.

The visualization looks good and conveys the idea pretty well.

### Honesty
The plot is honestly reproducing the data.

### Suggestion
It may be even better to add certain fit lines, because the scattered points exhibit a linear relationship.
