To run our ipython notebook, one must have the Citibike data of April 2015 in the same folder, because the file is too large to push to Github. We opt to use the April data, because we think that there exists a potentially higher level of bias in the summer data and the winter data.

Our null hypothesis is that "the ratio of trips > 30 minutes in the >= 35 age group is higher than or equal to the ratio of trips > 30 minutes in the < 35 age group." We think that younger people have a greater tendency to long trips than older people.

Our team collaborated well, and the work was distributed pretty evenly. We worked together in front of the same computer screen. I was involved throughout the whole process: establishing hypothesis, choosing data, cleaning data, grouping data, choosing test, testing hypothesis, and plotting data.
